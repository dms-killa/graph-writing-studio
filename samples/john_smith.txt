John Smith joined Acme Corp as a Senior Engineer in March 2023, reporting to 
Sarah Chen who leads the Platform Infrastructure team. He was previously at 
Globex Industries for 4 years where he built their real-time data pipeline 
using Apache Kafka and Flink.

At Acme, John was assigned to Project Aurora — an initiative to migrate the 
company's monolithic architecture to microservices. The project was originally 
led by Marcus Williams but he transitioned to an advisory role in August 2023 
when the scope expanded to include the API gateway rewrite.

In October 2023, Project Aurora hit a major blocker: the vendor contract with 
DataSync Inc. expired and renewal negotiations stalled over pricing. This 
delayed the Phase 2 milestone (service mesh deployment) by approximately 6 weeks.
Sarah escalated the issue to VP of Engineering David Park, who approved an 
alternative vendor evaluation.

By January 2024, the team had migrated to StreamCore as their data sync 
provider. John led the integration effort and completed Phase 2 on February 15.
The Phase 3 milestone (full production cutover) is currently scheduled for 
Q2 2024, pending load testing results.

John also mentors two junior engineers on the team: Lisa Nguyen (joined June 2023) 
and Raj Patel (joined September 2023). Lisa has been focusing on the 
observability stack (Prometheus + Grafana) while Raj handles the CI/CD pipeline 
using GitHub Actions and ArgoCD.
