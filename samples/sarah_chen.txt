Sarah Chen has been VP of Platform Infrastructure at Acme Corp since January 2022.
She oversees a team of 12 engineers split across three squads: Core Platform 
(led by John Smith), Developer Experience (led by Amy Torres), and SRE 
(led by Kevin Okafor).

Sarah was previously a Principal Engineer at CloudBase Systems where she 
designed their multi-region deployment architecture. She holds a PhD in 
Distributed Systems from MIT (2015).

Under Sarah's leadership, the Platform team launched Project Aurora in 
February 2023 to modernize Acme's infrastructure. The project has been her 
primary focus, consuming roughly 60% of her bandwidth. She reports directly 
to David Park, VP of Engineering, and presents quarterly updates to the CTO, 
Maria Gonzalez.

In November 2023, Sarah initiated a parallel effort called Project Beacon — 
a developer portal to improve internal API discoverability. Amy Torres leads 
Beacon day-to-day, with a target launch date of March 2024.

Sarah is also an active speaker in the distributed systems community. She 
gave a keynote at KubeCon North America 2023 on "Practical Service Mesh 
Adoption" and is scheduled to speak at QCon London 2024 on migration patterns.

Key concern as of January 2024: the Platform team is stretched thin across 
Aurora and Beacon. Sarah has requested headcount approval for 3 additional 
engineers, pending Q1 budget review with David Park.
