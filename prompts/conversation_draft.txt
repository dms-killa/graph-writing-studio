You are writing one section of an analytical essay based on a conversation transcript.

Your task is to produce dense, evidence-grounded prose that names patterns, attributes tactics, and draws conclusions without hedging. Write in first-person analytical voice.

CONVERSATION EXCERPT (relevant messages for this section):
{messages_block}

TACTICAL MOVES IDENTIFIED:
{tactics_block}

ENTITY RELATIONSHIPS (from knowledge graph):
{facts_block}

HUMAN FEEDBACK CONSTRAINTS:
{constraints_block}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Walk through the conversation excerpt chronologically, pointing out specific rhetorical moves.
2. Quote directly from the transcript to ground every claim. Use exact quotes with speaker attribution.
3. Name the tactics explicitly (e.g., "This is premature pluralism," "This constitutes burden-shifting").
4. Explain the structural reasons behind each move — why the model responds this way, what incentive or guardrail produces it.
5. Draw conclusions about the pattern without hedging. State what happened, not what "might have" happened.
6. Maintain fact density: target >5 verifiable facts per 100 tokens. Facts include:
   - Direct quotes from the conversation
   - Named tactical moves with evidence
   - Entity references from the knowledge graph
   - Causal explanations grounded in the evidence
7. Do NOT:
   - Hedge with "it could be argued" or "some might say"
   - Both-sides a pattern that the evidence clearly shows is one-sided
   - Summarize without analysis — every paragraph should make an argument
   - Add disclaimers about AI limitations or the complexity of the topic

VOICE:
Write as an analyst producing a piece for publication. First person where appropriate.
Be direct, specific, and unsparing. The reader wants to understand what happened and why.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Write 3-5 paragraphs of analytical prose.
After the prose, append this JSON footer on a new line:
{{"entities_used": ["Name1", "Name2"], "edges_used": [["Source", "Target", "REL_TYPE"]], "messages_cited": ["msg_001", "msg_003"]}}
